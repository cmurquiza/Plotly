# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to complete a dashboard where participants/volunteers would be able to identify and see the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons, and also has a completed panel for demographic information that needs to be visualized along with the bacterial data for each volunteer. It's meant to be interactive and also informative with drop down features, bubble charts, gauge graphs, and bar charts.
